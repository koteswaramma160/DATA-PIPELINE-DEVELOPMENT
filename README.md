âœ… Task 1: Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Title: Data Preprocessing and Transformation Pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn

Description:
This project demonstrates how to create a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python using Pandas and Scikit-learn. The pipeline handles missing values, scales numerical data, and encodes categorical variables automatically.

Technologies:

    Python

    Pandas

    Scikit-learn

How to Run:

Place your dataset as sample_data.csv in the working directory.

Run the script task1_etl_pipeline.py or Jupyter Notebook provided.

The processed training and test datasets will be saved as CSV files.

Outputs:

X_train_processed.csv

X_test_processed.csv
