✅ *Task 1* : Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Title: Data Preprocessing and Transformation Pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn

Description:
This project demonstrates how to create a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python using Pandas and Scikit-learn. The pipeline handles missing values, scales numerical data, and encodes categorical variables automatically.

Technologies:

    Python

    Pandas

    Scikit-learn
    
    
How to Run:

Place your dataset as sample_data.csv in the working directory.

Run the script task-1.py or Jupyter Notebook provided.

The processed training and test datasets will be saved as numpy arrays in the variables x_train_processed and x_test_processed.


Outputs:

X_train_processed
X_test_processed



✅ *Task 2*: Deep Learning Model for Image Classification

Title: Deep Learning Image Classification using TensorFlow (MNIST)

Description:
This project implements a simple image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras on the popular MNIST dataset. The model predicts handwritten digits and visualizes training and validation accuracy.

Technologies:

    Python

    TensorFlow/Keras

    Matplotlib
    

How to Run:

Run the file task-2.py in Jupyter Notebook or vs code
The model will train for 5 epochs and plot accuracy curves.

Outputs:

Accuracy plot curve
Test accuracy printed in console.



✅ *Task 3*: End-to-End Data Science Project with Flask

Title: House Price Prediction Web App using Flask

Description:
A complete machine learning workflow deployed using Flask. Users can input house area and get predicted house prices based on a Linear Regression model trained on housing.csv.

Technologies:

    Python

    Flask

    Scikit-learn

    Pandas

How to Run:

Place housing.csv in the project folder.
Run the Flask app: python3 task-3.py
Access the web app at http://127.0.0.1:5070 (or the chosen port).


Outputs:

Web-based house price predictions.



✅ Task 4: Optimization Model using Linear Programming

Title: Business Optimization using Linear Programming (PuLP)

Description:
This project solves a basic business optimization problem (maximize profit given constraints) using Linear Programming and the PuLP library.

Technologies:

    Python

    PuLP

How to Run:

Run the script task-4.py or the corresponding notebook.
The console will display the optimal solution, decision variables, and maximum profit.


Outputs:

Optimal solution printed in the console.
